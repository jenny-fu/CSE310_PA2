 ALTERNATING BIT AND GO-BACK-N NETWORK EMULATOR: VERSION 1.1  J.F.Kurose

   This code should be used for PA2, unidirectional or bidirectional
   data transfer protocols (from A to B. Bidirectional transfer of data
   is for extra credit and is not required).  Network properties:
   - one way network delay averages five time units (longer if there
     are other messages in the channel for GBN), but can be larger
   - packets can be corrupted (either the header or the data portion)
     or lost, according to user-defined probabilities
   - packets will be delivered in the order in which they were sent
     (although some can be lost).

 The only instance variable of the Msg class is the data field.  Data is just
 a bytes object that represents the application data being passed to you
 reliable delivery transport protocol.

 The Pkt class represents the transport layer segment used by your reliable
 transport protocol.
 The Pkt class has four attributes.  seqnum is the sequence number assigned to
 the Pkt object, the acknum is the acknowledgement number sent in response, and
 the checksum is the checksum calculated for this segment. Finally, payload is
 where the application layer data is stored--it is a bytes object just like the
 field in a Msg object.

***************** NETWORK EMULATION CODE STARTS BELOW ***********
The code below emulates the layer 3 and below network environment:
  - emulates the tranmission and delivery (possibly with bit-level corruption
    and packet loss) of packets across the layer 3/4 interface
  - handles the starting/stopping of a timer, and generates timer
    interrupts (resulting in calling students timer handler).
  - generates message to be sent (passed from later 5 to 4)

THERE IS NOT REASON THAT ANY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE TO READ OR UNDERSTAND
THE CODE BELOW.  YOU SHOLD NOT TOUCH, OR REFERENCE (in your code) ANY
OF THE DATA STRUCTURES BELOW.  If you're interested in how I designed
the emulator, you're welcome to look at the code - but again, you shouldn't
have to, and you defeinitely should not have to modify
